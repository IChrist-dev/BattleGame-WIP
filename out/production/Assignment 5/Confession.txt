Occasionally I found in testing that the scanner-input spell-
name would not be recognized. It was a bizarre error that I 
spent multiple hours trying to trace. Ultimately I could find
no probable cause in my own code so I could only determine that
something is misfiring with the scanner class; that perhaps
it was modifying the input string in an unpredictable way.
This is a minute error as pretty much of the time the program
runs flawlessly.
